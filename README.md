# Sample Governor

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case for building a complete governance system. It comes with contracts, tests, and scripts that allow the developer to test different governance implementations.

Familiarize yourself by running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
*Pay attention to the console logs! - They make things much easier :)
